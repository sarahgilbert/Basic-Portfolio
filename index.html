        My name is Sarah Gilbert. I live in Centennial, Colorado with my husband, Dave, and our two sons. For the past 20 years, I have been working in the field of public education both as a teacher, and as a school administrator. I have loved my time as an educator and I look forward to bringing my passion and skills to a new profession. I am currently enrolled in the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp and hope to transition into the field of Web Development within the next few months.
